Introduction

Yeaaaaaaah

Installation
------------

Using Composer (recommended)
----------------------------
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to clone the repository and manually invoke `composer` using the shipped
`composer.phar`:

    cd my/project/dir
    git clone git://github.com/cosmobile/kpe14.git
    cd kontatto
    php composer.phar self-update
    php composer.phar install

(The `self-update` directive is to ensure you have an up-to-date `composer.phar`
available.)
